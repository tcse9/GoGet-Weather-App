This app is a single page demo application which demonstrates weather forecast.

##### This app uses the following technologies
  - MVVM as the the design pattern, it also has Singletone.
  - Retrofit with RxJava
  - Dagger2 as Dependency Injection
  - Databindings
  - There is a test case written in /src/test/java/com/binate/gogetweatherapp/MainActivityTest.java. We have used Mockito and Robolectric for unit test purpose
  - The main page color will change according to weather i.e. if current weather is rainy then it will show a color, if it is clear then the backgroud color will be something else.
